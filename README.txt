Adds sheep to Minetest (requires Animals mod available from https://github.com/danielmeek32/animals).

Sheep spawn on grass blocks.
Untamed sheep remain for 7 1/2 minutes before despawning.
Sheep will follow players holding wheat.
Sheep can be tamed by feeding them wheat.
Tamed sheep can be bred by feeding them wheat.
Once fed, sheep will breed for up to 10 seconds.
Sheep cannot breed more than once in 5 minutes.

Sheep will drop 1-2 wool when killed or 2-3 wool when sheared using shears.
Sheep will periodically eat grass blocks, turning the grass block to a dirt block and regrowing their wool.
Shears are crafted by using 2 steel ingots and one stick in following shape:

  - 	ingot
ingot 	stick
